### Interstellar Alien Communication
If one day we discovered messages being beamed to earth from interstellar sources, how would we know what they are saying? How would scientists decipher the meaning of the transmissions if they were not encoded in any language known to humankind?  We would naturally start by doing what our brains do best, searching for patterns. Universal patterns that do not require a codebook to decipher. We might look for repetitive sequences in the data. We might group together sequences that are similar but different. By doing this we can slowly learn what the rules of the encoding scheme are and unlock their meaning. Learning patterns from raw unlabeled data is what unsupervised machine learning is all about. The unlabeled data problem does not just apply to interstellar alien communication. It is also at the foundation of all biological sensory-motor systems. In other words, it is fundamental to life itself. 

### Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence  
Unsupervised machine learning is fundamental to life itself? That is a bold statement. This may seem unlikely since this is something that most people have never even heard of. This is because the field has been relegated to a niche corner of the broader and vastly trendier topic of machine learning and artificial intelligence generally. Exciting new developments in just the past decade have energized the field with powerful tools that have applications in a broad range of industries. Funding has flooded into research to make better products and services. Big data is plentiful and the cost of manual labeling is small compared to the value of the models once they are put into production. Supervised methods that require extensive data labeling have been so effective, they have overshadowed the less effective unsupervised methods that often shared the spotlight equally only a decade ago, when the whole industry was struggling to make advances. 

### Unsupervised Methods  
Even though unsupervised methods are more challenging with seemingly fewer immediate payoffs, research in the field has not ceased however. For many artificial intelligence and machine learning researchers, what drives their curiosity and excitement is solving the mystery of the human brain. And it only takes a moment of reflection to realise that our brains are incredibly adept at  processing raw, messy sensory information and seemingly like magic recognizing many layers of patterns. How this works has been a mystery since ancient times, and now we are finally assembling a set of tools that could finally bring us to a truer understanding of how our minds turn the seeming chaos of jiggling molecules of the physical world into the world of order, structure and meaning.

### Introducing Unsupervised Papers
Bringing together the unsupervised machine learning papers that document our current understanding of these tools in one directory is the goal of the UnsupervisedPapers.com website. It is intended to serve a few audiences in particular. First the machine learning researcher or practitioner who would like a quick reference to the state of the art in unsupervised methods will find this site useful. Also, this will be an invaluable tool for students and educators to assist with in-depth research into the field. And lastly, it will be a great resource for hackers and ameture artificial intelligence enthusiasts to dip their toe into what promises to be a field with a very exciting future.

### Getting Started
The structure of the website is inspired heavily by PapersWithCode.com. There is a directory of tasks as well as a directory of methods so papers can be browsed and discovered by category. Each entry includes links to important resources such as code repositories, project websites, articles, talks and demos. The entire directory is free and open-source. This is a collaborative project and contributions are welcome via our GitHub page https://github.com/virtualgraham/unsupervisedpapers. All the entries from the site are encoded as markdown and image files in the repository. This enables the free and open, but moderated system of changes that Git was built for.  There is also of course this blog, where I might occasionally rant and rave about the potential of unsupervised learning to unlock the great mysteries of life. Feel free to skip this section if you like.
