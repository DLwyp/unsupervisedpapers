  "abstract": "Abstract A partially unsupervised approach to the classification of multitemporal remote-sensing images is presented. Such an approach allows the automatic classification of a remote-sensing image for which training data are not available, drawing on the information derived from an image acquired in the same area at a previous time. In particular, the proposed technique is based on a cascade-classifier approach and on a specific formulation of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm used for the unsupervised estimation of the statistical parameters of the image to be classified. The results of experiments carried out on a multitemporal data set confirm the validity of the proposed approach.",
