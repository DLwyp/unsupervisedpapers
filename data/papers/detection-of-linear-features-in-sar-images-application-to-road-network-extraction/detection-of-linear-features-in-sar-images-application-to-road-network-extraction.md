  "abstract": "The authors propose a two-step algorithm for almost unsupervised detection of linear structures, in particular, main axes in road networks, as seen in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. The first step is local and is used to extract linear features from the speckle radar image, which are treated as road-segment candidates. The authors present two local line detectors as well as a method for fusing information from these detectors. In the second global step, they identify the real roads among the segment candidates by defining a Markov random field (MRF) on a set of segments, which introduces contextual knowledge about the shape of road objects. The influence of the parameters on the road detection is studied and results are presented for various real radar images.",
