  "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce SLQS , a new entropy-based measure for the unsupervised identification of hypernymy and its directionality in Distributional Semantic Models (DSMs). SLQS is assessed through two tasks: (i.) identifying the hypernym in hyponym-hypernym pairs, and (ii.) discriminating hypernymy among various semantic relations. In both tasks, SLQS outperforms other state-of-the-art measures.",
