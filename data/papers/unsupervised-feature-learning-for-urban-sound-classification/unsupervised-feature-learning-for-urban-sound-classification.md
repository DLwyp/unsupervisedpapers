  "abstract": "Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of unsupervised feature learning for sound classification. In this paper we further explore the application of the spherical k-means algorithm for feature learning from audio signals, here in the domain of urban sound classification. Spherical k-means is a relatively simple technique that has recently been shown to be competitive with other more complex and time consuming approaches. We study how different parts of the processing pipeline influence performance, taking into account the specificities of the urban sonic environment. We evaluate our approach on the largest public dataset of urban sound sources available for research, and compare it to a baseline system based on MFCCs. We show that feature learning can outperform the baseline approach by configuring it to capture the temporal dynamics of urban sources. The results are complemented with error analysis and some proposals for future research.",
