  "abstract": "In this paper we present a spoken query detection method based on posteriorgrams generated from Deep Boltzmann Machines (DBMs). The proposed method can be deployed in both semi-supervised and unsupervised training scenarios. The DBM-based posteriorgrams were evaluated on a series of keyword spotting tasks using the TIMIT speech corpus. In unsupervised training conditions, the DBM-approach improved upon our previous best unsupervised keyword detection performance using Gaussian mixture model-based posteriorgrams by over 10%. When limited amounts of labeled data were incorporated into training, the DBM-approach required less than one third of the annotated data in order to achieve a comparable performance of a system that used all of the annotated data for training.",
