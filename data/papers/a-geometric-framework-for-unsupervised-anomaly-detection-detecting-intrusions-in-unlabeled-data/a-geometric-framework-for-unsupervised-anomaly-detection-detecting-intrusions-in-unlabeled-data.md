  "abstract": "Most current intrusion detection systems employ signature-based methods or data mining-based methods which rely on labeled training data. This training data is typically expensive to produce. We present a new geometric framework for unsupervised anomaly detection, which are algorithms that are designed to process unlabeled data. In our framework, data elements are mapped to a feature space which is typically a vector space â„›d. Anomalies are detected by determining which points lies in sparse regions of the feature space. We present two feature maps for mapping data elements to a feature space. Our first map is a data-dependent normalization feature map which we apply to network connections. Our second feature map is a spectrum kernel which we apply to system call traces. We present three algorithms for detecting which points lie in sparse regions of the feature space. We evaluate our methods by performing experiments over network records from the KDD CUP 1999 data set and system call traces from the 1999 Lincoln Labs DARPA evaluation.",
