  "abstract": "In the downlink transmission scenario, power allocation and beamforming design at the transmitter are essential when using multiple antenna arrays. This paper considers a multiple input–multiple output broadcast channel to maximize the weighted sum-rate under the total power constraint. The classical weighted minimum mean-square error (WMMSE) algorithm can obtain suboptimal solutions but involves high computational complexity. To reduce this complexity, we propose a fast beamforming design method using unsupervised learning, which trains the deep neural network (DNN) offline and provides real-time service online only with simple neural network operations. The training process is based on an end-to-end method without labeled samples avoiding the complicated process of obtaining labels. Moreover, we use the “APoZ”-based pruning algorithm to compress the network volume, which further reduces the computational complexity and volume of the DNN, making it more suitable for low computation-capacity devices. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method improves computational speed significantly with performance close to the WMMSE algorithm.",
