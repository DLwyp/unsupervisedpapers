  "abstract": "We present a generic framework to make wrapper induction algorithms tolerant to noise in the training data. This enables us to learn wrappers in a completely unsupervised manner from automatically and cheaply obtained noisy training data, e.g., using dictionaries and regular expressions. By removing the site-level supervision that wrapper-based techniques require, we are able to perform information extraction at web-scale, with accuracy unattained with existing unsupervised extraction techniques. Our system is used in production at Yahoo! and powers live applications.",
