  "abstract": "We apply techniques from Bayesian generative statistical modeling to uncover hidden features in jet substructure observables that discriminate between different a priori unknown underlying short distance physical processes in multi-jet events. In particular, we use a mixed membership model known as Latent Dirichlet Allocation to build a data-driven unsupervised top-quark tagger and $t\\bar t$ event classifier. We compare our proposal to existing traditional and machine learning approaches to top jet tagging. Finally, employing a toy vector-scalar boson model as a benchmark, we demonstrate the potential for discovering New Physics signatures in multi-jet events in a model independent and unsupervised way.",
