  "abstract": "In this paper, we tackle the problem of unsupervised domain adaptation for classification. In the unsupervised scenario where no labeled samples from the target domain are provided, a popular approach consists in transforming the data such that the source and target distributions become similar. To compare the two distributions, existing approaches make use of the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). However, this does not exploit the fact that probability distributions lie on a Riemannian manifold. Here, we propose to make better use of the structure of this manifold and rely on the distance on the manifold to compare the source and target distributions. In this framework, we introduce a sample selection method and a subspace-based method for unsupervised domain adaptation, and show that both these manifold-based techniques outperform the corresponding approaches based on the MMD. Furthermore, we show that our subspace-based approach yields state-of-the-art results on a standard object recognition benchmark.",
