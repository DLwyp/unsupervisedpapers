  "abstract": "Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) sensors have become increasingly common in both industrial and robotic applications. LIDAR sensors are particularly desirable for their direct distance measurements and high accuracy, but traditionally have been configured with only a single rotating beam. However, recent technological progress has spawned a new generation of LIDAR sensors equipped with many simultaneous rotating beams at varying angles, providing at least an order of magnitude more data than single-beam LIDARs and enabling new applications in mapping [6], object detection and recognition [15], scene understanding [16], and SLAM [9].",
