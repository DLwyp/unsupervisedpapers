  "abstract": "Live fish recognition is one of the most crucial elements of fisheries survey applications where the vast amount of data is rapidly acquired. Different from general scenarios, challenges to underwater image recognition are posted by poor image quality, uncontrolled objects and environment, and difficulty in acquiring representative samples. In addition, most existing feature extraction techniques are hindered from automation due to involving human supervision. Toward this end, we propose an underwater fish recognition framework that consists of a fully unsupervised feature learning technique and an error-resilient classifier. Object parts are initialized based on saliency and relaxation labeling to match object parts correctly. A non-rigid part model is then learned based on fitness, separation, and discrimination criteria. For the classifier, an unsupervised clustering approach generates a binary class hierarchy, where each node is a classifier. To exploit information from ambiguous images, the notion of partial classification is introduced to assign coarse labels by optimizing the benefit of indecision made by the classifier. Experiments show that the proposed framework achieves high accuracy on both public and self-collected underwater fish images with high uncertainty and class imbalance.",
