  "abstract": "Recently, the introduction of the generative adversarial network (GAN) and its variants has enabled the generation of realistic synthetic samples, which has been used for enlarging training sets. Previous work primarily focused on data augmentation for semi-supervised and supervised tasks. In this paper, we instead focus on unsupervised anomaly detection and propose a novel generative data augmentation framework optimized for this task. In particular, we propose to oversample infrequent normal samples - normal samples that occur with small probability, e.g., rare normal events. We show that these samples are responsible for false positives in anomaly detection. However, oversampling of infrequent normal samples is challenging for real-world high-dimensional data with multimodal distributions. To address this challenge, we propose to use a GAN variant known as the adversarial autoencoder (AAE) to transform the high-dimensional multimodal data distributions into low-dimensional unimodal latent distributions with well-defined tail probability. Then, we systematically oversample at the 'edge' of the latent distributions to increase the density of infrequent normal samples. We show that our oversampling pipeline is a unified one: it is generally applicable to datasets with different complex data distributions. To the best of our knowledge, our method is the first data augmentation technique focused on improving performance in unsupervised anomaly detection. We validate our method by demonstrating consistent improvements across several real-world datasets.",
