  "abstract": "We describe a texture analysis system in which informative discrimination rules are learned from a multiresolution representation of time textured input. The system incorporates unsupervised and supervised learning via statistical machine learning and rule-based neural networks, respectively. The textured input is represented in the frequency-orientation space via a log-Gabor pyramidal decomposition. In the unsupervised learning stage a statistical clustering scheme is used for the quantization of the feature-vector attributes. A supervised stage follows in which labeling of the textured map is achieved using a rule-based network. Simulation results for the texture classification task are given. An application of the system to real-world problems is demonstrated. >",
