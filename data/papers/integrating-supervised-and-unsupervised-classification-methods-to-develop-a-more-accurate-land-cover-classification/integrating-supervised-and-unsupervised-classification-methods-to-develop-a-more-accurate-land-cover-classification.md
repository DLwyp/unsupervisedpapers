  "abstract": "The classificationand mapping of land cover provides fundamentalinformation about the characteristics, activities, and status of specific areas on the earth's surface. The quality of the final classificationis critical in providing accurate information for ecologistsand resource managers in decision-making and for developing a landscape-level understanding of an ecosystem. A land cover classificationwas developed for 5 research watershedsin Garland and Saline counties in Arkansas using 2002 LANDSAT7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) satelliteimagery. The supervisedclassificationwas based upon 146 training areas identified from reference data and then applied to the imagery using the maximum likelihood classification algorithm.The unsupervised classificationused an Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis Techniques (ISODATA)algorithm to classify the imagery into 300 spectral classes which then were identified from reference data. Data from 171field locations were used to assess the accuracy of the final classificationsusing an error matrix. The supervised classificationhad an overall accuracyof 74.85%compared to 40.94%for the unsupervised classification.However, the dense canopy pine plantation class, whichcomprises 10.69%of the total area of the watersheds(1,216.69ha), was more accurately classifiedin the unsupervised classification(64.29%) than the supervised classification (43.86%).The unsupervised classification of dense canopy pine plantation was incorporated into the supervised classificationto producea final integrated classification with an improved overallaccuracy of 76.61%.Wefound that, where greater accuracy is desired, both classificationmethods shouldbe used and theresults integrated to utilize each method's strengths.",
