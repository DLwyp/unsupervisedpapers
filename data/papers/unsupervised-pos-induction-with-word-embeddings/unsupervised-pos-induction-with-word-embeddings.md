  "abstract": "Unsupervised word embeddings have been shown to be valuable as features in supervised learning problems; however, their role in unsupervised problems has been less thoroughly explored. In this paper, we show that embeddings can likewise add value to the problem of unsupervised POS induction. In two representative models of POS induction, we replace multinomial distributions over the vocabulary with multivariate Gaussian distributions over word embeddings and observe consistent improvements in eight languages. We also analyze the effect of various choices while inducing word embeddings on \"downstream\" POS induction results.",
