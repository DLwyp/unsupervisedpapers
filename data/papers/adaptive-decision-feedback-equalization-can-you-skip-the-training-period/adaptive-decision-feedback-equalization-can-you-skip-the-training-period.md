  "abstract": "This paper presents a novel unsupervised (blind) adaptive decision feedback equalizer (DFE). It can be thought of as the cascade of four devices, whose main components are a purely recursive filter (/spl Rscr/) and a transversal filter (/spl Tscr/). Its major feature is the ability to deal with severe quickly time-varying channels, unlike the conventional adaptive DFE. This result is obtained by allowing the new equalizer to modify, in a reversible way, both its structure and its adaptation according to some measure of performance such as the mean-square error (MSE). In the starting mode, /spl Rscr/ comes first and whitens its own output by means of a prediction principle, while /spl Tscr/ removes the remaining intersymbol interference (ISI) thanks to the Godard (1980) (or Shalvi-Weinstein (1990)) algorithm. In the tracking mode the equalizer becomes the classical DFE controlled by the decision-directed (DD) least-mean-square (LMS) algorithm. With the same computational complexity, the new unsupervised equalizer exhibits the same convergence speed, steady-state MSE, and bit-error rate (BER) as the trained conventional DFE, but it requires no training. It has been implemented on a digital signal processor (DSP) and tested on underwater communications signals-its performances are really convincing.",
