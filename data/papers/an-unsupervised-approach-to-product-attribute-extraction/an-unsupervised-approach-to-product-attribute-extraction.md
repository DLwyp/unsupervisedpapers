  "abstract": "Product Attribute Extraction is the task of automatically discovering attributes of products from text descriptions. In this paper, we propose a new approach which is both unsupervised and domain independent to extract the attributes. With our approach, we are able to achieve 92% precision and 62% recall in our experiments. Our experiments with varying dataset sizes show the robustness of our algorithm. We also show that even a minimum of 5 descriptions provide enough information to identify attributes.",
