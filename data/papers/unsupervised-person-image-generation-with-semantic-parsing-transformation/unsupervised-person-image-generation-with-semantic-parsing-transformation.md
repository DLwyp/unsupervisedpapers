  "abstract": "In this paper, we address unsupervised pose-guided person image generation, which is known challenging due to non-rigid deformation. Unlike previous methods learning a rock-hard direct mapping between human bodies, we propose a new pathway to decompose the hard mapping into two more accessible subtasks, namely, semantic parsing transformation and appearance generation. Firstly, a semantic generative network is proposed to transform between semantic parsing maps, in order to simplify the non-rigid deformation learning. Secondly, an appearance generative network learns to synthesize semantic-aware textures. Thirdly, we demonstrate that training our framework in an end-to-end manner further refines the semantic maps and final results accordingly. Our method is generalizable to other semantic-aware person image generation tasks, e.g., clothing texture transfer and controlled image manipulation. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method on DeepFashion and Market-1501 datasets, especially in keeping the clothing attributes and better body shapes.",
