  "abstract": "In this work, we propose a lightweight approach for keyword extraction and ranking based on an unsupervised methodology to select the most important keywords of a single document. To understand the merits of our proposal, we compare it against RAKE, TextRank and SingleRank methods (three well-known unsupervised approaches) and the baseline TF.IDF, over four different collections to illustrate the generality of our approach. The experimental results suggest that extracting keywords from documents using our method results in a superior effectiveness when compared to similar approaches.",
