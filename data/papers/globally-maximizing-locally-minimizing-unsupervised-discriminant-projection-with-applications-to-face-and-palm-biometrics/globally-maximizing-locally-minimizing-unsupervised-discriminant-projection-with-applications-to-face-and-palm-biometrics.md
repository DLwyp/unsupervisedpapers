  "abstract": "This paper develops an unsupervised discriminant projection (UDP) technique for dimensionality reduction of high-dimensional data in small sample size cases. UDP can be seen as a linear approximation of a multimanifolds-based learning framework which takes into account both the local and nonlocal quantities. UDP characterizes the local scatter as well as the nonlocal scatter, seeking to find a projection that simultaneously maximizes the nonlocal scatter and minimizes the local scatter. This characteristic makes UDP more intuitive and more powerful than the most up-to-date method, locality preserving projection (LPP), which considers only the local scatter for clustering or classification tasks. The proposed method is applied to face and palm biometrics and is examined using the Yale, FERET, and AR face image databases and the PolyU palmprint database. The experimental results show that UDP consistently outperforms LPP and PCA and outperforms LDA when the training sample size per class is small. This demonstrates that UDP is a good choice for real-world biometrics applications",
