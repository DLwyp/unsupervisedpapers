  "abstract": "Cell phone text messaging users express themselves briefly and colloquially using a variety of creative forms. We analyze a sample of creative, non-standard text message word forms to determine frequent word formation processes in texting language. Drawing on these observations, we construct an unsupervised noisy-channel model for text message normalization. On a test set of 303 text message forms that differ from their standard form, our model achieves 59% accuracy, which is on par with the best supervised results reported on this dataset.",
