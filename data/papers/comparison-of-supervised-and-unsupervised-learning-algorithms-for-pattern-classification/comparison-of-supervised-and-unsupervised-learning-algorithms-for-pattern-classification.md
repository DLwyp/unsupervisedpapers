  "abstract": "This paper presents a comparative account of unsupervised and supervised learning models and their pattern classification evaluations as applied to the higher education scenario. Classification plays a vital role in machine based learning algorithms and in the present study, we found that, though the error back-propagation learning algorithm as provided by supervised learning model is very efficient for a number of non-linear real-time problems, KSOM of unsupervised learning model, offers efficient solution and classification in the present study.",
