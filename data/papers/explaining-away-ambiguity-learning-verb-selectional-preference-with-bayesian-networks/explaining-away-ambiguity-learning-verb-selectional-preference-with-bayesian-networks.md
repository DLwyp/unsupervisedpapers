  "abstract": "This paper presents a Bayesian model for unsupervised learning of verb selectional preferences. For each verb the model creates a Bayesian network whose architecture is determined by the lexical hicrarchy of Wordnet and whose parameters are estimated from a list of verb-object pairs found from a corpus. \"Explaining away\", a well-known property of Bayesian networks, helps the model deal in a natural fashion with word sense ambiguity in the training data. On a word sense disambiguation test our model performed better than other state of the art systems for unsupervised learning of selectional preferences. Computational complexity problems, ways of improving this approach and methods for implementing \"explaining away\" in other graphical frameworks are discussed.",
