  "abstract": "In this paper, a graph-based nonlocal total variation method is proposed for unsupervised classification of hyperspectral images (HSI). The variational problem is solved by the primal-dual hybrid gradient algorithm. By squaring the labeling function and using a stable simplex clustering routine, an unsupervised clustering method with random initialization can be implemented. The effectiveness of this proposed algorithm is illustrated on both synthetic and real-world HSI, and numerical results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms other standard unsupervised clustering methods, such as spherical <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$K$ </tex-math></inline-formula>-means, nonnegative matrix factorization, and the graph-based Merriman–Bence–Osher scheme.",
