  "abstract": "Finding domain invariant features is critical for successful domain adaptation and transfer learning. However, in the case of unsupervised adaptation, there is a significant risk of overfitting on source training data. Recently, a regularization for domain adaptation was proposed for deep models by (Ganin and Lempitsky, 2015). We build on their work by suggesting a more appropriate regularization for denoising autoencoders. Our model remains unsupervised and can be computed in a closed form. On standard text classification adaptation tasks, our approach yields the state of the art results, with an important reduction of the learning cost.",
