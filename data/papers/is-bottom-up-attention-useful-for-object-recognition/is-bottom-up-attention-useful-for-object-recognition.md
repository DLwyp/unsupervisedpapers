  "abstract": "A key problem in learning multiple objects from unlabeled images is that it is a priori impossible to tell which part of the image corresponds to each individual object, and which part is irrelevant clutter which is not associated to the objects. We investigate empirically to what extent pure bottom-up attention can extract useful information about the location, size and shape of objects from images and demonstrate how this information can be utilized to enable unsupervised learning of objects from unlabeled images. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach to using bottom-up attention is indeed useful for a variety of applications.",
