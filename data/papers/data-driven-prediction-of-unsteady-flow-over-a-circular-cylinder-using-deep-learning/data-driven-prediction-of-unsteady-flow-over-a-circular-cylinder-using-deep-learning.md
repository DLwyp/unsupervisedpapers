  "abstract": "Unsteady flow fields over a circular cylinder are trained and predicted using four deep learning networks: networks associated with supervised feature extraction with and without prior knowledge of physical conservation laws, networks associated with unsupervised feature extraction with and without prior knowledge of conservation laws. Flow fields at Reynolds numbers 100, 200, 300, and 400 are trained, while flow fields at Reynolds numbers 500 and 3000 are predicted. Physical loss functions are proposed to explicitly impose prior knowledge of physical conservation laws to deep learning networks, while an adversarial training is applied to extract features of physical conservation laws in an unsupervised manner without any prior knowledge of the conservation laws. Effects of the proposed loss functions and adversarial training are analyzed. Flow field predictions using deep learning networks show good agreement with flow fields calculated by numerical simulations. Especially, unsupervised feature extractions can be applied to extract undiscovered prior knowledge in data, where many practical data lacks information of full underlying physics. The present study suggests that deep learning techniques can be utilized for predicting wake flow.",
