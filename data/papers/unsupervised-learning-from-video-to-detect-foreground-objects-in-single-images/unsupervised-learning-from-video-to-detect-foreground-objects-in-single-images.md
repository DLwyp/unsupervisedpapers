  "abstract": "Unsupervised learning from visual data is one of the most difficult challenges in computer vision. It is essential for understanding how visual recognition works. Learning from unsupervised input has an immense practical value, as huge quantities of unlabeled videos can be collected at low cost. Here we address the task of unsupervised learning to detect and segment foreground objects in single images. We achieve our goal by training a student pathway, consisting of a deep neural network that learns to predict, from a single input image, the output of a teacher pathway that performs unsupervised object discovery in video. Our approach is different from the published methods that perform unsupervised discovery in videos or in collections of images at test time. We move the unsupervised discovery phase during the training stage, while at test time we apply the standard feed-forward processing along the student pathway. This has a dual benefit: firstly, it allows, in principle, unlimited generalization possibilities during training, while remaining fast at testing. Secondly, the student not only becomes able to detect in single images significantly better than its unsupervised video discovery teacher, but it also achieves state of the art results on two current benchmarks, YouTube Objects and Object Discovery datasets. At test time, our system is two orders of magnitude faster than other previous methods.",
