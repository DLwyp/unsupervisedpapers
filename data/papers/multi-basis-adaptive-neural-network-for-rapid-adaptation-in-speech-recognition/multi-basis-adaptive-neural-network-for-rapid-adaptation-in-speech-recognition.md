  "abstract": "Recent progress in acoustic modeling with deep neural network has significantly improved the performance of automatic speech recognition systems. However, it remains as an open problem how to rapidly adapt these networks with limited, unsupervised, data. Most existing methods to adapt a neural network involve modifying a large number of parameters thus rapid adaptation is not possible with these schemes. In this paper, the multi-basis adaptive neural network is proposed, a new neural network configuration which only requires very few parameters for adaptation. By modifying the topology of a single multi-layer perception, a set of sub-networks with restricted connectivity are introduced to collaboratively capture different acoustic properties. The outputs of those sub-networks are combined by speaker-dependent interpolation weights. In addition, the complete system can be optimized in an adaptive training fashion when non-homogeneous training data are used. The performance of unsupervised adaptation is evaluated on two datasets. It outperforms the speaker-independent hybrid DNN-HMM baseline both on the Broadcast News English and the AURORA-4 tasks.",
