  "abstract": "Resistive switching memory (RRAM) has been proposed as an artificial synapse in neuromorphic circuits due to its tunable resistance, low power operation, and scalability. For the development of high-density neuromorphic circuits, it is essential to validate the state-of-the-art bistable RRAM and to introduce small-area building blocks serving as artificial synapses. This paper introduces a new synaptic circuit consisting of a one-transistor/one-resistor structure, where the resistive element is a HfO2 RRAM with bipolar switching. The spike-timing-dependent plasticity is demonstrated in both the deterministic and stochastic regimes of the RRAM. Finally, a fully connected neuromorphic network is simulated showing online unsupervised pattern learning and recognition for various voltages of the POST spike. The results support bistable RRAM for high-performance artificial synapses in neuromorphic circuits.",
