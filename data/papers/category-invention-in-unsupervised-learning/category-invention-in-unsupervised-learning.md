  "abstract": "The study of concepts and category learning has long been a focus of research in cognitive psychology. Most of this research has studied supervised category learning, in which a tutor provides the subjects with category labels and feedback relevant to the success criterion of the learning task (e.g., Bruner, Goodnow, & Austin, 1956; see Millward, 1971, for a review). By contrast, unsupervised learning has received much less attention by experimental psychologists. In unsupervised learning, subjects must invent and use categories without predefined category labels or feedback from an external tutor. Many categories that people learn in real life are acquired in observational, untutored conditions and thus are examples of unsupervised learning. Much of our knowledge about the properties and behavior of common physical objects, social interactions, linguistic classes and rules, and everyday tasks and procedures may be learned in this manner (Billman & Heit, 1988). Any learning by pioneers about a novel environment is unsupervised because they must invent their own categories for describing that environment and generate their own criteria for classifying stimuli into these categories. This article describes a recently developed procedure for investigating unsupervised learning (see Clapper & Bower, 1991) and three experiments in which this procedure was used to test theories of how categories could be learned and represented in unsupervised tasks. We begin by describing more precisely what we mean by an unsupervised learning task and how categories could be defined within such a task. We then argue that models of unsupervised learning can be divided into two general types, which differ in how category knowledge is represented in long-term memory and the processes by which this knowledge is abstracted from individual training instances. After providing this background, we describe the attribute-listing paradigm and show how it can be",
