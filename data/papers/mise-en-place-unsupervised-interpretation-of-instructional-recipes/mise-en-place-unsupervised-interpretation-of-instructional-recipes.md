  "abstract": "We present an unsupervised hard EM approach to automatically mapping instructional recipes to action graphs, which define what actions should be performed on which objects and in what order. Recovering such structures can be challenging, due to unique properties of procedural language where, for example, verbal arguments are commonly elided when they can be inferred from context and disambiguation often requires world knowledge. Our probabilistic model incorporates aspects of procedural semantics and world knowledge, such as likely locations and selectional preferences for different actions. Experiments with cooking recipes demonstrate the ability to recover high quality action graphs, outperforming a strong sequential baseline by 8 points in F1, while also discovering general-purpose knowledge about cooking.",
