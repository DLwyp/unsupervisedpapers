  "abstract": "Brain-inspired computation can revolutionize information technology by introducing machines capable of recognizing patterns (images, speech, video) and interacting with the external world in a cognitive, humanlike way. Achieving this goal requires first to gain a detailed understanding of the brain operation, and second to identify a scalable microelectronic technology capable of reproducing some of the inherent functions of the human brain, such as the high synaptic connectivity (~104) and the peculiar time-dependent synaptic plasticity. Here we demonstrate unsupervised learning and tracking in a spiking neural network with memristive synapses, where synaptic weights are updated via brain-inspired spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP). The synaptic conductance is updated by the local time-dependent superposition of pre- and post-synaptic spikes within a hybrid one-transistor/one-resistor (1T1R) memristive synapse. Only 2 synaptic states, namely the low resistance state (LRS) and the high resistance state (HRS), are sufficient to learn and recognize patterns. Unsupervised learning of a static pattern and tracking of a dynamic pattern of up to 4 × 4 pixels are demonstrated, paving the way for intelligent hardware technology with up-scaled memristive neural networks.",
