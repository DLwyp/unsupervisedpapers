  "abstract": "UNLABELLED\nThe advent of high-density, high-volume genomic data has created the need for tools to summarize large datasets at multiple scales. HMMSeg is a command-line utility for the scale-specific segmentation of continuous genomic data using hidden Markov models (HMMs). Scale specificity is achieved by an optional wavelet-based smoothing operation. HMMSeg is capable of handling multiple datasets simultaneously, rendering it ideal for integrative analysis of expression, phylogenetic and functional genomic data.\n\n\nAVAILABILITY\nhttp://noble.gs.washington.edu/proj/hmmseg",
