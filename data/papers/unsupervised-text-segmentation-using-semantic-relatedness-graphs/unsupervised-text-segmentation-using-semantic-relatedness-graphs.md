  "abstract": "Segmenting text into semantically coherent \nfragments improves readability of text \nand facilitates tasks like text summarization \nand passage retrieval. In this paper, \nwe present a novel unsupervised algorithm \nfor linear text segmentation (TS) \nthat exploits word embeddings and a measure \nof semantic relatedness of short texts \nto construct a semantic relatedness graph \nof the document. Semantically coherent \nsegments are then derived from maximal \ncliques of the relatedness graph. The algorithm \nperforms competitively on a standard \nsynthetic dataset and outperforms the \nbest-performing method on a real-world \n(i.e., non-artificial) dataset of political manifestos.",
