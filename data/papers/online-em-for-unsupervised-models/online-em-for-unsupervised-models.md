  "abstract": "The (batch) EM algorithm plays an important role in unsupervised induction, but it sometimes suffers from slow convergence. In this paper, we show that online variants (1) provide significant speedups and (2) can even find better solutions than those found by batch EM. We support these findings on four unsupervised tasks: part-of-speech tagging, document classification, word segmentation, and word alignment.",
