  "abstract": "Previous work on 3D action recognition has focused on using hand-designed features, either from depth videos or 2D videos. In this work, we present an effective way to combine unsupervised feature learning with discriminative feature mining. Unsupervised feature learning allows us to extract spatio-temporal features from unlabeled video data. With this, we can avoid the cumbersome process of designing feature extraction by hand. We propose an ensemble approach using a discriminative learning algorithm, where each base learner is a discriminative multi-kernel-learning classifier, trained to learn an optimal combination of joint-based features. Our evaluation includes a comparison to state-of-the-art methods on the MSRAction 3D dataset, where our method, abbreviated EnMkl, outperforms earlier methods. Furthermore, we analyze the efficiency of our approach in a 3D action recognition system. HighlightsWe deal with recognizing 3D human actions by combining two ideas: unsupervised feature learning and discriminative feature mining.We are the first work to use unsupervised learning to represent 3D depth video data.We propose an ensemble approach with a discriminative multi-kernel learning algorithm to model 3D human actions.",
