  "abstract": "The visual attributes of cells, such as the nuclear morphology and chromatin openness, are critical for histopathology image analysis. By learning cell-level visual representation, we can obtain a rich mix of features that are highly reusable for various tasks, such as cell-level classification, nuclei segmentation, and cell counting. In this paper, we propose a unified generative adversarial networks architecture with a new formulation of loss to perform robust cell-level visual representation learning in an unsupervised setting. Our model is not only label-free and easily trained but also capable of cell-level unsupervised classification with interpretable visualization, which achieves promising results in the unsupervised classification of bone marrow cellular components. Based on the proposed cell-level visual representation learning, we further develop a pipeline that exploits the varieties of cellular elements to perform histopathology image classification, the advantages of which are demonstrated on bone marrow datasets.",
