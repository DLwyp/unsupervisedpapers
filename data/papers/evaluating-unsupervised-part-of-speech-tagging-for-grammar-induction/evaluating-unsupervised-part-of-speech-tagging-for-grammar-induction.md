  "abstract": "This paper explores the relationship between various measures of unsupervised part-of-speech tag induction and the performance of both supervised and unsupervised parsing models trained on induced tags. We find that no standard tagging metrics correlate well with unsupervised parsing performance, and several metrics grounded in information theory have no strong relationship with even supervised parsing performance.",
