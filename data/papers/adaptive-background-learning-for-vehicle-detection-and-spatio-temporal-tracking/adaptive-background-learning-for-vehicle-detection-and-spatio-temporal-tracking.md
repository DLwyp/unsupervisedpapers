  "abstract": "Traffic video analysis can provide a wide range of useful information such as vehicle identification, traffic flow, to traffic planners. In this paper, a framework is proposed to analyze the traffic video sequence using unsupervised vehicle detection and spatio-temporal tracking that includes an image/video segmentation method, a background learning/subtraction method and an object tracking algorithm. A real-life traffic video sequence from a road intersection is used in our study and the experimental results show that our proposed unsupervised framework is effective in vehicle tracking for complex traffic situations.",
