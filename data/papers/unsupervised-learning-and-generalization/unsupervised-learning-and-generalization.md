  "abstract": "The concept of generalization is defined for a general class of unsupervised learning machines. The generalization error is a straightforward extension of the corresponding concept for supervised learning, and may be estimated empirically using a test set or by statistical means-in close analogy with supervised learning. The empirical and analytical estimates are compared for principal component analysis and for K-means clustering based density estimation.",
