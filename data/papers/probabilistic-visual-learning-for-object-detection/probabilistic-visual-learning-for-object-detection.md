  "abstract": "We present an unsupervised technique for visual learning which is based on density estimation in high-dimensional spaces using an eigenspace decomposition. Two types of density estimates are derived for modeling the training data: a multivariate Gaussian (for a unimodal distributions) and a multivariate Mixture-of-Gaussians model (for multimodal distributions). These probability densities are then used to formulate a maximum-likelihood estimation framework for visual search and target detection for automatic object recognition. This learning technique is tested in experiments with modeling and subsequent detection of human faces and non-rigid objects such as hands.<<ETX>>",
