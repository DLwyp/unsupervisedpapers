  "abstract": "In this paper, we present an unsupervised learning framework to address the problem of detecting spoken keywords. Without any transcription information, a Gaussian Mixture Model is trained to label speech frames with a Gaussian posteriorgram. Given one or more spoken examples of a keyword, we use segmental dynamic time warping to compare the Gaussian posteriorgrams between keyword samples and test utterances. The keyword detection result is then obtained by ranking the distortion scores of all the test utterances. We examine the TIMIT corpus as a development set to tune the parameters in our system, and the MIT Lecture corpus for more substantial evaluation. The results demonstrate the viability and effectiveness of our unsupervised learning framework on the keyword spotting task.",
