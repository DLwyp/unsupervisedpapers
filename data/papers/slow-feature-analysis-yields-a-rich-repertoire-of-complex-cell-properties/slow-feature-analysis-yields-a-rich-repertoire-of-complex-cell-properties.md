  "abstract": "In this study we investigate temporal slowness as a learning principle for receptive fields using slow feature analysis, a new algorithm to determine functions that extract slowly varying signals from the input data. We find a good qualitative and quantitative match between the set of learned functions trained on image sequences and the population of complex cells in the primary visual cortex (V1). The functions show many properties found also experimentally in complex cells, such as direction selectivity, non-orthogonal inhibition, end-inhibition, and side-inhibition. Our results demonstrate that a single unsupervised learning principle can account for such a rich repertoire of receptive field properties.",
