  "abstract": "Feature selection plays a crucial role in scientific research and practical applications. In the real world applications, labeling data is time and labor consuming. Thus, unsupervised feature selection methods are desired for many practical applications. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) with trace ratio criterion is a supervised dimensionality reduction method that has shown good performance to improve classifications. In this paper, we first propose a unified objective to seamlessly accommodate trace ratio formulation and K-means clustering procedure, such that the trace ratio criterion is extended to unsupervised model. After that, we propose a novel unsupervised feature selection method by integrating unsupervised trace ratio formulation and structured sparsity-inducing norms regularization. The proposed method can harness the discriminant power of trace ratio criterion, thus it tends to select discriminative features. Meanwhile, we also provide two important theorems to guarantee the unsupervised feature selection process. Empirical results on four benchmark data sets show that the proposed method outperforms other sate-of-the-art unsupervised feature selection algorithms in all three clustering evaluation metrics.",
