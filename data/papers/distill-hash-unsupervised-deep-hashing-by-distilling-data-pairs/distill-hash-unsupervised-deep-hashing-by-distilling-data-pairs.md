  "abstract": "Due to storage and search efficiency, hashing has become significantly prevalent for nearest neighbor search. Particularly, deep hashing methods have greatly improved the search performance, typically under supervised scenarios. In contrast, unsupervised deep hashing models can hardly achieve satisfactory performance due to the lack of supervisory similarity signals. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a new deep unsupervised hashing model, called DistilHash, which can learn a distilled data set, where data pairs have confident similarity signals. Specifically, we investigate the relationship between the initial but noisy similarity signals learned from local structures and the semantic similarity labels assigned by the optimal Bayesian classifier. We show that, under a mild assumption, some data pairs, of which labels are consistent with those assigned by the optimal Bayesian classifier, can be potentially distilled. With this understanding, we design a simple but effective method to distill data pairs automatically and further adopt a Bayesian learning framework to learn hashing functions from the distilled data set. Extensive experimental results on three widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art search performance.",
