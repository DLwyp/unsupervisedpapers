  "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised domain adaptation algorithm based on deep learning for visual object recognition. Specifically, we design a new model called Deep Reconstruction-Classification Network (DRCN), which jointly learns a shared encoding representation for two tasks: (i) supervised classification of labeled source data, and (ii) unsupervised reconstruction of unlabeled target data. In this way, the learnt representation not only preserves discriminability, but also encodes useful information from the target domain. Our new DRCN model can be optimized by using backpropagation similarly as the standard neural networks.",
