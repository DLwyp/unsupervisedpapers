  "abstract": "In this work, we study the unsupervised video object segmentation problem where moving objects are segmented without prior knowledge of these objects. First, we propose a motion-based bilateral network to estimate the background based on the motion pattern of non-object regions. The bilateral network reduces false positive regions by accurately identifying background objects. Then, we integrate the background estimate from the bilateral network with instance embeddings into a graph, which allows multiple frame reasoning with graph edges linking pixels from different frames. We classify graph nodes by defining and minimizing a cost function, and segment the video frames based on the node labels. The proposed method outperforms previous state-of-the-art unsupervised video object segmentation methods against the DAVIS 2016 and the FBMS-59 datasets.",
