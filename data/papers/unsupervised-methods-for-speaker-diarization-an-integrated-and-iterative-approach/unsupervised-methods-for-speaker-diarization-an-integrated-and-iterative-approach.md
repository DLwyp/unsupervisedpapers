  "abstract": "In speaker diarization, standard approaches typically perform speaker clustering on some initial segmentation before refining the segment boundaries in a re-segmentation step to obtain a final diarization hypothesis. In this paper, we integrate an improved clustering method with an existing re-segmentation algorithm and, in iterative fashion, optimize both speaker cluster assignments and segmentation boundaries jointly. For clustering, we extend our previous research using factor analysis for speaker modeling. In continuing to take advantage of the effectiveness of factor analysis as a front-end for extracting speaker-specific features (i.e., i-vectors), we develop a probabilistic approach to speaker clustering by applying a Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to principal component analysis (PCA)-processed i-vectors. We then utilize information at different temporal resolutions to arrive at an iterative optimization scheme that, in alternating between clustering and re-segmentation steps, demonstrates the ability to improve both speaker cluster assignments and segmentation boundaries in an unsupervised manner. Our proposed methods attain results that are comparable to those of a state-of-the-art benchmark set on the multi-speaker CallHome telephone corpus. We further compare our system with a Bayesian nonparametric approach to diarization and attempt to reconcile their differences in both methodology and performance.",
