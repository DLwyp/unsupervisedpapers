  "abstract": "We introduce a simple wrapper method that uses off-the-shelf word embedding algorithms to learn task-specific bilingual word embeddings. We use a small dictionary of easily-obtainable task-specific word equivalence classes to produce mixed context-target pairs that we use to train off-the-shelf embedding models. Our model has the advantage that it (a) is independent of the choice of embedding algorithm, (b) does not require parallel data, and (c) can be adapted to specific tasks by re-defining the equivalence classes. We show how our method outperforms off-the-shelf bilingual embeddings on the task of unsupervised cross-language partof-speech (POS) tagging, as well as on the task of semi-supervised cross-language super sense (SuS) tagging.",
