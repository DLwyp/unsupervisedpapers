  "abstract": "Colorization of grayscale images is a hot topic in computer vision. Previous research mainly focuses on producing a color image to recover the original one in a supervised learning fashion. However, since many colors share the same gray value, an input grayscale image could be diversely colorized while maintaining its reality. In this paper, we design a novel solution for unsupervised diverse colorization. Specifically, we leverage conditional generative adversarial networks to model the distribution of real-world item colors, in which we develop a fully convolutional generator with multi-layer noise to enhance diversity, with multi-layer condition concatenation to maintain reality, and with stride 1 to keep spatial information. With such a novel network architecture, the model yields highly competitive performance on the open LSUN bedroom dataset. The Turing test on 80 humans further indicates our generated color schemes are highly convincible.",
