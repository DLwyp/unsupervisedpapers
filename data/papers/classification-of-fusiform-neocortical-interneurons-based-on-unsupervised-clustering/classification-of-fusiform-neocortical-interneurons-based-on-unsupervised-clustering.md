  "abstract": "A classification of fusiform neocortical interneurons (n = 60) was performed with an unsupervised cluster analysis based on the comparison of multiple electrophysiological and molecular parameters studied by patch-clamp and single-cell multiplex reverse transcription-PCR in rat neocortical acute slices. The multiplex reverse transcription-PCR protocol was designed to detect simultaneously the expression of GAD65, GAD67, calbindin, parvalbumin, calretinin, neuropeptide Y, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), somatostatin (SS), cholecystokinin, alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid, kainate, N-methyl-d-aspartate, and metabotropic glutamate receptor subtypes. Three groups of fusiform interneurons with distinctive features were disclosed by the cluster analysis. The first type of fusiform neuron (n = 12), termed regular spiking nonpyramidal (RSNP)-SS cluster, was characterized by a firing pattern of RSNP cells and by a high occurrence of SS. The second type of fusiform neuron (n = 32), termed RSNP-VIP cluster, predominantly expressed VIP and also showed firing properties of RSNP neurons with accommodation profiles different from those of RSNP-SS cells. Finally, the last type of fusiform neuron (n = 16) contained a majority of irregular spiking-VIPergic neurons. In addition, the analysis of glutamate receptors revealed cell-type-specific expression profiles. This study shows that combinations of multiple independent criteria define distinct neocortical populations of interneurons potentially involved in specific functions.",
