  "abstract": "We present an automated system for assigning protein, gene, or mRNA class labels to biological terms in free text. Three machine learning algorithms and several extended ways for defining contextual features for disambiguation are examined, and a fully unsupervised manner for obtaining training examples is proposed. We train and evaluate our system over a collection of 9 million words of molecular biology journal articles, obtaining accuracy rates up to 85%.",
