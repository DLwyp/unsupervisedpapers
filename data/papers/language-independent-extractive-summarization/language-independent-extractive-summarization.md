  "abstract": "We demonstrate TextRank -- a system for unsupervised extractive summarization that relies on the application of iterative graph-based ranking algorithms to graphs encoding the cohesive structure of a text. An important characteristic of the system is that it does not rely on any language-specific knowledge resources or any manually constructed training data, and thus it is highly portable to new languages or domains.",
