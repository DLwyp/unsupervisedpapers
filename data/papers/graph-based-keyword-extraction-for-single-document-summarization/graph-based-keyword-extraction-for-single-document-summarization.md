  "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce and compare between two novel approaches, supervised and unsupervised, for identifying the keywords to be used in extractive summarization of text documents. Both our approaches are based on the graph-based syntactic representation of text and web documents, which enhances the traditional vector-space model by taking into account some structural document features. In the supervised approach, we train classification algorithms on a summarized collection of documents with the purpose of inducing a keyword identification model. In the unsupervised approach, we run the HITS algorithm on document graphs under the assumption that the top-ranked nodes should represent the document keywords. Our experiments on a collection of benchmark summaries show that given a set of summarized training documents, the supervised classification provides the highest keyword identification accuracy, while the highest F-measure is reached with a simple degree-based ranking. In addition, it is sufficient to perform only the first iteration of HITS rather than running it to its convergence.",
