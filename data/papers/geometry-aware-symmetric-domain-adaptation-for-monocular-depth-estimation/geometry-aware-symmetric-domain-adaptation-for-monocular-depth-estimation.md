  "abstract": "Supervised depth estimation has achieved high accuracy due to the advanced deep network architectures. Since the groundtruth depth labels are hard to obtain, recent methods try to learn depth estimation networks in an unsupervised way by exploring unsupervised cues, which are effective but less reliable than true labels. An emerging way to resolve this dilemma is to transfer knowledge from synthetic images with ground truth depth via domain adaptation techniques. However, these approaches overlook specific geometric structure of the natural images in the target domain (i.e., real data), which is important for high-performing depth prediction. Motivated by the observation, we propose a geometry-aware symmetric domain adaptation framework (GASDA) to explore the labels in the synthetic data and epipolar geometry in the real data jointly. Moreover, by training two image style translators and depth estimators symmetrically in an end-to-end network, our model achieves better image style transfer and generates high-quality depth maps. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method and comparable performance against the state-of-the-art.",
