  "abstract": "In this paper, we propose an Online unsupervised Multi-View Feature Selection method, OMVFS, which deals with large-scale/streaming multi-view data in an online fashion. OMVFS embeds unsupervised feature selection into a clustering algorithm via nonnegative matrix factorization with sparse learning. It further incorporates the graph regularization to preserve the local structure information and help select discriminative features. Instead of storing all the historical data, OMVFS processes the multi-view data chunk by chunk and aggregates all the necessary information into several small matrices. By using the buffering technique, the proposed OMVFS can reduce the computational and storage cost while taking advantage of the structure information. Furthermore, OMVFS can capture the concept drifts in the data streams. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed OMVFS method. More importantly, OMVFS is about 100 times faster than the off-line methods.",
