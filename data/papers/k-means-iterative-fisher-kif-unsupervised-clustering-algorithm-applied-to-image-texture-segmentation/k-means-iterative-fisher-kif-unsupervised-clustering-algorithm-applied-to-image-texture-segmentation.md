  "abstract": "Abstract The K-means Iterative Fisher (KIF) algorithm is a robust, unsupervised clustering algorithm applied here to the problem of image texture segmentation. The KIF algorithm involves two steps. First, K-means is applied. Second, the K-means class assignments are used to estimate parameters required for a Fisher linear discriminant (FLD). The FLD is applied iteratively to improve the solution. This combined K-means and iterative FLD is referred to as the KIF algorithm. Two KIF implementations are presented: a mixture resolving approach is extended to an unsupervised binary hierarchical approach. The same binary hierarchical KIF algorithm is used to properly segment images even though the number of classes, the class spatial boundaries, and the number of samples per class vary. The binary hierarchical KIF algorithm is fully unsupervised, requires no a priori knowledge of the number of classes, is a non-parametric solution, and is computationally efficient compared to other methods used for clustering in image texture segmentation solutions. This unsupervised methodology is demonstrated to be an improvement over other published texture segmentation results using a wide variety of test imagery. Gabor filters and co-occurrence probabilities are used as texture features.",
