  "abstract": "Estimating depth from a single image is a very challenging and exciting topic in computer vision with implications in several application domains. Recently proposed deep learning approaches achieve outstanding results by tackling it as an image reconstruction task and exploiting geometry constraints (e.g., epipolar geometry) to obtain supervisory signals for training. Inspired by these works and compelling results achieved by Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) on image reconstruction and generation tasks, in this paper we propose to cast unsupervised monocular depth estimation within a GAN paradigm. The generator network learns to infer depth from the reference image to generate a warped target image. At training time, the discriminator network learns to distinguish between fake images generated by the generator and target frames acquired with a stereo rig. To the best of our knowledge, our proposal is the first successful attempt to tackle monocular depth estimation with a GAN paradigm and the extensive evaluation on CityScapes and KITTI datasets confirm that it enables to improve traditional approaches. Additionally, we highlight a major issue with data deployed by a standard evaluation protocol widely used in this field and fix this problem using a more reliable dataset recently made available by the KITTI evaluation benchmark.",
