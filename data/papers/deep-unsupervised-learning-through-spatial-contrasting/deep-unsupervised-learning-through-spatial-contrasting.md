  "abstract": "Convolutional networks have marked their place over the last few years as the\nbest performing model for various visual tasks. They are, however, most suited\nfor supervised learning from large amounts of labeled data. Previous attempts\nhave been made to use unlabeled data to improve model performance by applying\nunsupervised techniques. These attempts require different architectures and training methods.\nIn this work we present a novel approach for unsupervised training\nof Convolutional networks that is based on contrasting between spatial regions\nwithin images. This criterion can be employed within conventional neural net-\nworks and trained using standard techniques such as SGD and back-propagation,\nthus complementing supervised methods.",
