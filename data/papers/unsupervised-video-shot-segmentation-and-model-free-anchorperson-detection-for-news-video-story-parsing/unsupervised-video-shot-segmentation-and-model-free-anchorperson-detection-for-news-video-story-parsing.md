  "abstract": "News story parsing is an important and challenging task in a news video library system. We address two important components in a news video story parsing system: shot boundary detection and anchorperson detection. First, an unsupervised fuzzy c-means algorithm is used to detect video-shot boundaries in order to segment a news video into video shots. Then, a graph-theoretical cluster analysis algorithm is implemented to classify the video shots into anchorperson shots and news footage shots. Because of its unsupervised nature, the algorithms require little human intervention. The efficacy of the proposed method is extensively tested on more than five hours of news programs.",
