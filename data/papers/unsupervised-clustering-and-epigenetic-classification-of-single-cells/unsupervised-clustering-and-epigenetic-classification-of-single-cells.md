  "abstract": "Characterizing epigenetic heterogeneity at the cellular level is a critical problem in the modern genomics era. Assays such as single cell ATAC-seq (scATAC-seq) offer an opportunity to interrogate cellular level epigenetic heterogeneity through patterns of variability in open chromatin. However, these assays exhibit technical variability that complicates clear classification and cell type identification in heterogeneous populations. We present scABC, an R package for the unsupervised clustering of single-cell epigenetic data, to classify scATAC-seq data and discover regions of open chromatin specific to cell identity.Single cell ATAC-seq (scATAC-seq) data reveals cellular level epigenetic heterogeneity but its application in delineating distinct subpopulations is still challenging. Here, the authors develop scABC, a statistical method for unsupervised clustering of scATAC-seq data and identification of open chromatin regions specific to cell identity.",
