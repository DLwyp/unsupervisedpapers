  "abstract": "This paper presents our recent effort that aims at improving our Arabic broadcast news (BN) recognition system by using thousands of hours of un-transcribed Arabic audio in the way of unsupervised training. Unsupervised training is first carried out on the 1,900-hour English topic detection and tracking (TDT) data and is compared with the lightly-supervised training method that we have used for the DARPA EARS evaluations. The comparison shows that unsupervised training produces a 21.7% relative reduction in word error rate (WER), which is comparable to the gain obtained with light supervision methods. The same unsupervised training strategy carried out on a similar amount of Arabic BN data produces an 11.6% relative gain. The gain, though considerable, is substantially smaller than what is observed on the English data. Our initial work towards understanding the reasons for this difference is also described",
