  "abstract": "From the Publisher: \n\"Face Image Analysis by Unsupervised Learning explores adaptive approaches to image analysis. It draws upon principles of unsupervised learning and information theory to adapt processing to the immediate task environment. In contrast to more traditional approaches to image analysis in which relevant structure is determined in advance and extracted using hand-engineered techniques, Face Image Analysis by Unsupervised Learning explores methods that have roots in biological vision and/or learn about the image structure directly from the image ensemble. Particular attention is paid to unsupervised learning techniques for encoding the statistical dependencies in the image ensemble.\" \"Face Image Analysis by Unsupervised Learning is suitable as a secondary text for a graduate level course and as a reference for researchers and practitioners in industry.\"--BOOK JACKET.",
