  "abstract": "A brain-computer interface (BCI) is a communication system that allows to control a computer or any other device thanks to the brain activity. The BCI described in this paper is based on the P300 speller BCI paradigm introduced by Farwell and Donchin. An unsupervised algorithm is proposed to enhance P300 evoked potentials by estimating spatial filters; the raw EEG signals are then projected into the estimated signal subspace. Data recorded on three subjects were used to evaluate the proposed method. The results, which are presented using a Bayesian linear discriminant analysis classifier, show that the proposed method is efficient and accurate.",
