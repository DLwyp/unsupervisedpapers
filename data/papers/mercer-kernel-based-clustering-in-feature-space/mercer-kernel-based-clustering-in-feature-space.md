  "abstract": "The article presents a method for both the unsupervised partitioning of a sample of data and the estimation of the possible number of inherent clusters which generate the data. This work exploits the notion that performing a nonlinear data transformation into some high dimensional feature space increases the probability of the linear separability of the patterns within the transformed space and therefore simplifies the associated data structure. It is shown that the eigenvectors of a kernel matrix which defines the implicit mapping provides a means to estimate the number of clusters inherent within the data and a computationally simple iterative procedure is presented for the subsequent feature space partitioning of the data.",
