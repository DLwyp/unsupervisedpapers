  "abstract": "Keyphrase extraction is a fundamental technique in natural language processing. It enables documents to be mapped to a concise set of phrases that can be used for indexing, clustering, ontology building, auto-tagging and other information organization schemes. Two major families of unsupervised keyphrase extraction algorithms may be characterized as statistical and graph-based. We present a hybrid statistical-graphical algorithm that capitalizes on the heuristics of both families of algorithms and is able to outperform the state of the art in unsupervised keyphrase extraction on several datasets.",
