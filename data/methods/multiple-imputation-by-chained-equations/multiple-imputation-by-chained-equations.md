Missing data are a common problem in psychiatric research. Multivariate imputation by chained equations (MICE), sometimes called “fully conditional specification” or “sequential regression multiple imputation” has emerged in the statistical literature as one principled method of addressing missing data. Creating multiple imputations, as opposed to single imputations, accounts for the statistical uncertainty in the imputations. In addition, the chained equations approach is very flexible and can handle variables of varying types (e.g. continuous or binary) as well as complexities such as bounds or survey skip patterns.
