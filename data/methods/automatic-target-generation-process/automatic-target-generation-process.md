The technique, called **automatic target generation process** (ATGP), automatically detects a set of spectrally distinct targets in a hyperspectral image, with the ultimate goal of characterizing the different spectral constituents that compose the scene. It is widely used in applications involving the detection and monitoring of fires, oil spills ,and other types of chemical and biological agents.
