Minimum-cover curve detection is an object detection method that interprets an image in terms of a small set of curves. The  minimum-cover  framework  gives  a  general,  well-founded approach for interpreting images with multiple objects. In  particular,  the  greedy  approximation  algorithm can be used in a wide variety of situations, including cases where there are different types of objects in an image.  It provides an alternative to sequentially selecting the best single object interpretation of the image. A minimum cost density algorithm is used for finding salient curves.  The method exploits the fact that curves can be generated by a sequential growth process that starts from a relatively small number of basic tokens (the segments). The quality of a curve can be used as an effective figure of merit to decide which curves to keep growing and when the process can stop.
