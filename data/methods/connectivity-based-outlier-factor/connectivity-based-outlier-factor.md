**Connectivity-based outlier factor** is a technique for outlier detection. It is an improved version of LOF (local outlier factor) technique. The idea of Connectivity based outlier algorithm is to assign degree of outlier to each data point. This degree of outlier is called connectivity based outlier factor; COF of the data point. High COF value of data point represent the high probability of being an outlier.
