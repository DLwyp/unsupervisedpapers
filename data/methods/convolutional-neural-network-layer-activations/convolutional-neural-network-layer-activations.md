**Convolutional neural network layer activations** have been found to be transferable as features to other tasks, different from the one that was used to train the convolutional neural network. What is more, different layers provide different features, where it is intuitively understood that features which are closer to the input are more general and the ones closer to the output more specific. These different features extracted from various layers of a convolutional neural network have differences in their effectiveness for the new task, for which those features are used.

Features extracted from deep CNN trained on large and diverse datasets, combined with classic clustering algorithms, can compete with more sophisticated and tuned image-set clustering methods.
