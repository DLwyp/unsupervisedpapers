MCMC is a computer–driven sampling method. It allows one to characterize a distribution without knowing all of the distribution’s mathematical properties by randomly sampling values out of the distribution. A particular strength of MCMC is that it can be used to draw samples from distributions even when all that is known about the distribution is how to calculate the density for different samples. The name MCMC combines two properties: Monte–Carlo and Markov chain.Footnote 1 Monte–Carlo is the practice of estimating the properties of a distribution by examining random samples from the distribution. For example, instead of finding the mean of a normal distribution by directly calculating it from the distribution’s equations, a Monte–Carlo approach would be to draw a large number of random samples from a normal distribution, and calculate the sample mean of those. The benefit of the Monte–Carlo approach is clear: calculating the mean of a large sample of numbers can be much easier than calculating the mean directly from the normal distribution’s equations. This benefit is most pronounced when random samples are easy to draw, and when the distribution’s equations are hard to work with in other ways.
