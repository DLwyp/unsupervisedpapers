Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is a technique used for estimating the parameters of a given distribution, using some observed data. For example, if a population is known to follow a normal distribution but the mean and variance are unknown, MLE can be used to estimate them using a limited sample of the population, by finding particular values of the mean and variance so that the observation is the most likely result to have occurred.
