Temporally consistent clusters over many frames can be obtained best by analyzing long term point trajectories rather than two-frame motion fields. In order to compute such trajectories, a tracker which is based on large displacement optical flow is used. It provides subpixel accurate tracks on one hand, and can deal with the large motion of limbs or the background on the other. Moreover, in contrast to traditional feature point trackers, it provides arbitrarily dense trajectories, so it allows to assign region labels far more densely
