GIST descriptors describe the structure of an image using the concept of a spatial envelope. The spatial envelope of an environmental scene may be described as a set of perceptual properties (naturalness, openness, roughness, ruggedness and expansion). These properties are related to the shape of the space and are meaningful to human observers. The spatial envelope properties provide a holistic description of the scene where local object information is not taken into account.
